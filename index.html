								</header>
								<p id="story">
									As a student of Computer Engineering (at <i>Universidad Simón Bolívar</i> - Venezuela), I began my journey as a generalist programmer, working on basic tools & small projects typical of every formal education institution out there.<br>
									<br>
									But as I explored many of the branches available to me, I found myself particularly interested on two subdomains<span id="dotsStory">...</span><span id="moreStory">: <br>
									<br>
									<i>Language Processing</i>, and <i>Game Development.</i> <br>
									<br>
									The combination of which, led me down a rabbit hole that saw me spending the better part of my first 3 indie years studying linguistics and game design as a solo developer, in order to build a text recognition & processing engine that was to be used as part of a game centered around a Robin Hood-esque conman, with a silver tongue. <br>
									<br>
									To my dismay, and despite my stubborness, this project proved to be beyond my capabilities at the time, considering the resources I had access to. Meaning that, a working executable was never achieved. <br> 
									<br>
									And so, the project was archived, and I've worked on smaller projects ever since.

													This was a project led by alias "AudioDread", for whom I led the programming efforts. However, the project never really got off the ground before the team dissolved. And so, the project got <b>abandoned</b>. <br>
													<br>
													By that time, I had been able to get a functioning custom-made character controller with coyote time, the ability to switch between dimensions (Heaven and Hell), and the ability to partially shift dimension, enabling you to phase through obstacles and launch yourself through the air like a rubber band. <br>
													<br>
													While we didn't get the chance to explore those mechanics, I believe we had an interesting core that held some potential. But you'll be a better judge of that. <br>

												FMOD-RMVXA Interface
											</h3>
											<p id="description">
												The FMOD middleware does not support RPG Maker VX Ace (RMVXA) out of the box. Therefore, in order to make use of it, an interface with the FMOD API was needed.  <br>
												This is such interface, however rudimentary<span id="dotsFMOD">...</span>.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="fit">
											<span id="moreFMOD">
												<p id="description">
													Back when I used to work with RMVXA instead of Unity, I made this interface for the API so that I could make use of FMOD's 3D audio panning capabilities. <br>
													<br>
													The project this was intended for, was Project Conman (the game I alluded to in the "My Story" section), which was a top-down 2D stealth game. <br>
													<br>
													What I wanted for such project was to imitate the soundscape that was so characteristic of the <i>Thief</i> saga, in which you can use your very own ears to accurately measure the distance and position of enemies. And FMOD would have given me such capabilities. <br>
													<br>
													And so, this plugin was born. Which wasn't without trouble due to the scarce amount of DLL-reading libraries packed within the RMVXA proprietary Ruby Interpreter. <br>

													This is something I made for a college course, back in the day. <br>
													<br>
													The aim was to learn the fundamentals of coding computer-language interpreters. But since the project was one of those few noteworthy assignments that one is lucky enough to have dropped on you, then I decided to showcase it for such reason. <br>
													<br>
													The tool in question really excels at making drawings that exhibit regular patterns. <br>
