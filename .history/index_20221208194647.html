								</header>
								<p id="Story" class="description">
									As a student of Computer Engineering (at <i>Universidad Simón Bolívar</i> - Venezuela), I began my journey as a generalist programmer, working on basic tools & small projects typical of every formal education institution out there.<br>
									<br>
									But as I explored many of the branches available to me, I found myself particularly interested on two subdomains<span id="dotsStory">...</span><span id="moreStory">: <br>
									<br>
									<i>Language Processing</i>, and <i>Game Development.</i> <br>
									<br>
									The combination of which, led me down a rabbit hole that saw me spending the better part of my first 3 indie years studying linguistics and game design as a solo developer, in order to build a text recognition & processing engine that was to be used as part of a game centered around a Robin Hood-esque conman, with a silver tongue. <br>
									<br>
									To my dismay, and despite my stubborness, this project proved to be beyond my capabilities at the time, considering the resources I had access to. Meaning that, a working executable was never achieved. <br> 
									<br>
									And so, the project was archived, and I've worked on smaller projects ever since. <br>

													This is my current long-term project. And still very much a <i>work in progress</i>. <br>
													<br>
													This is a project made with the help of very young people, whom I've been helping learn each their respective craft, over the past year. <br>
													<br>
													The fundamental concept for the game is that ships have been getting wrecked left and right out in the ocean, in a quick succession of natural disasters that have left the people praying for mercy. <br>
													<br>
													It is your job, as master salvager, to make sure that these supplies left roaming in the sea do not get lost to nature. And so, it is up to you if you manage to make it back alive. <br>

													Developed originally for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in 48 hours. <br>
													<br>
													Along with some quite talented developers, I was able to bring this idea into fruition that came as a result of this year's theme, which was <i>"Roll of the Dice"</i>. <br>
													<br>
													Together, my team and I (totalling 3 people), came up with the concept for this game within the first 3 hours of the event. And so, we went into a mad dash to get it done under the allotted time of 48 hours. <br>
													<br>
													I came up with the initial concept of <i>rolling/wraping a die around objects</i>, and took some liberties with the interpretation for the theme, while the arena concept came as a result of our artist's (John Bone's) suggestion of using a darts board as the map. <br>
													<br>
													Making full use of the synergy we've developed over our whole year of shared experience, we managed to succeed in developing this prototype (which could subsequently be scaled into a proper casual game for mobile), under the allotted 48 hours, to critical acclaim from the other participants. <br>
													<br>
													This resulted in our game being ranked #850 overall from over 6100 other entries, which I can only qualify as a resounding success, considering it was our first game jam ever. <br>
													<br>
													By now, many of the glaring issues that were pointed out during the voting period have been ultimately fixed, and I'd consider this a solid entry into anyone's casual gaming library. <br>

												FMOD-RMVXA Interface
											</h3>
											<p id="FMOD" class="description">
												The FMOD middleware does not support RPG Maker VX Ace (RMVXA) out of the box. Therefore, in order to make use of it, an interface with the FMOD API was needed.  <br>
												This is such interface, however rudimentary<span id="dotsFMOD">...</span>.
											</p>

										<div class="fit">
											<span id="moreFMOD">
												<p class="description">
													Back when I used to work with RMVXA instead of Unity, I made this interface for the API so that I could make use of FMOD's 3D audio panning capabilities. <br>
													<br>
													The project this was intended for, was Project Conman (the game I alluded to in the "My Story" section), which was a top-down 2D stealth game. <br>
													<br>
													What I wanted for such project was to imitate the soundscape that was so characteristic of the <i>Thief</i> saga, in which you can use your very own ears to accurately measure the distance and position of enemies. And FMOD would have given me such capabilities. <br>
													<br>
													And so, this plugin was born. Which wasn't without trouble due to the scarce amount of DLL-reading libraries packed within the RMVXA proprietary Ruby Interpreter. <br>

													This is something I made for a college course, back in the day. <br>
													<br>
													The aim was to learn the fundamentals of coding computer-language interpreters. But since the project was one of those few noteworthy assignments that one is lucky enough to have dropped on you, then I decided to showcase it for such reason. <br>
													<br>
													The tool in question really excels at making drawings that exhibit regular patterns. <br>
